I have used gcc 4.4.3 native version and gcc 4.4.3 cross-compiler version to
compile these sources.
There are 4 targets "make ethernat", "make netusbee", "make aranym", "make ohci-pci".
If you use cross-compiler add "CROSS=yes" to the commands above.
Before compiling "ohci-pci" target you must "make clean" if you have been compiling the other targets before.
"make all" compiles the 4 targets.
