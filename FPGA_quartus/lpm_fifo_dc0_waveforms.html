<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_fifo_dc0.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo_mixed_widths megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_fifo_dc0.vhd".  The design "lpm_fifo_dc0.vhd" has a write-side depth of 32 words of 8 bits each. a read-side width of 32. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the FIFO under wrfull condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
