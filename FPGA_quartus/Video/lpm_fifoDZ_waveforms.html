<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_fifoDZ.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_fifoDZ.vhd".  The design "lpm_fifoDZ.vhd" has a depth of 128 words of 128 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
